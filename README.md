## 🧠 Topics Covered

| Topic                         | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basics**                    | Introduction to C syntax, structure, and simple input/output operations.                              |
| **Control Statements**        | Explains conditional logic with `if`, `else` and `switch` statements.                                 |
| **Loops**                     | Covers `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops for iteration.                                          |
| **1D Array**                  | Covers declaration, initialization, and traversal of single-dimensional arrays.                       |
| **2D Array**                  | Demonstrates working with two-dimensional arrays (matrices), including element access and operations. |
| **String**                    | Demonstrates string handling using arrays and string library functions.                               |
| **Dynamic Memory Allocation** | Teaches dynamic memory management using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.                    |
| **Functions**                 | Shows how to define and use user-defined functions to modularize code.                                |
| **Pointers**                  | Introduces pointer concepts such as memory addresses, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.          |
| **Struct**                    | Explains how to define and use structures to group related variables.                                 |
| **File Handling**             | Covers reading from and writing to files using `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, and `fclose`.            |
